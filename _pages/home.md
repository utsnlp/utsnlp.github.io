The [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au/){:target="_blank"} Natural Language Processing (**UTS NLP**) group is engaged in research within the field of natural language processing, with a primary aim of advancing language understanding and reasoning. 
We create innovative algorithms and devise fresh frameworks to address complex challenges in NLP, leveraging techniques such as deep learning and reinforcement learning. 

Our mission is to push the frontiers of artificial intelligence, simultaneously facilitating significant advancements in practical text processing applications with wide-ranging implications for real-world issues. 
Recently, our endeavors have concentrated on areas such as question answering, dialogue systems, language grounding, knowledge representation, reasoning, and the development of algorithms for learning from limited supervision.


 **We are  looking for passionate new PhD students, Postdocs, and Master students to join the team (see [Vacancies](vacancies)) !**
