  description: "A framework for running topic models via clustering contextual embeddings. 
    By clustering embeddings obtained from pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT) along 
    with a word-selecting method, we can obtain coherent and diverse topics, which 
    are simpler and more efficient than neural topic models.
