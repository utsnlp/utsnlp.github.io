  description: "A framework for running topic models via clustering contextual embeddings. 
    By clustering embeddings obtained from pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT) along 
    with a word-selecting method, we can obtain coherent and diverse topics, which 
    are simpler and more efficient than neural topic models.

  description: "A general algorithm is named Moral Awareness Adaptive Learning (MorAL). 
    It boosts an agent's moral capacity. 
    This is achieved using a moral-aware learning model plugin. 
    The algorithm lets the agent learn tasks and morality adaptively."

  authors: Zijing Shi, Yunqiu Xu, Meng Fang, Ling Chen
  description: "A confidence-based self-imitation model generates action candidates for the RL agent in text-based games. 
  It utilizes self-imitation learning to rank and leverage valuable past trajectories. 
  Also, a confidence-based strategy is used to assess the LMâ€™s confidence relative to a state.
