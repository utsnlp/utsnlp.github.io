The website template is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and is easy to use. You don't need much front-end knowledge to maintain the website. You can update information by only writing `markdown` and `yml` files.

## How to Maintain the Website

### Update Locally

If you want to make changes of the website and test it locally first, you need to install necessary environment. 

First, clone this repository: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/utsnlp/utsnlp.github.io.git
cd utsnlp.github.io
```

Then checkout to the `dev` branch, we recommend to do changes and test it on this branch before merging to the `main` branch:

```bash
git checkout dev
```

This website is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), install Jekyll and its prerequisites (e.g., Ruby, GEM) by following the [doc](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). 
Then, in the project folder, run 

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Open your browser and review the website at: http://localhost:4000. 
When the server is running, make your changes and refresh the website to review the changes.
Once you have finished updating, commit your changes and push them to Github on `dev` branch.

Raise a **pull request** and merge from `dev` to `main`. Github [actions](https://github.com/utsnlp/utsnlp.github.io/actions) will take care of the deployment. Now you can review the live site [utsnlp.github.io](https://utsnlp.github.io/).


### Update Directly

If you don't want to install the local environment, you can directly make changes by updating the **.md** or **.yml** files (see below), pushing the commits to Github, and reviewing the changes online. Note that, this will directly update the live site.


## Where to Maintain the Website
